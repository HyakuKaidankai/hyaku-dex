# Hyaku Dex

Astro project which contains a Pokedex for Pokemon Tabletop United 1.05. It contains some homebrew and other balance changes, so its not 1:1 with the official TTRPG.

## Features

- Focused on the desktop experience, but responsive enough for mobile
- All pokemon up to Generation 9 (Using Data's Homebrew Pokedex and the Community Gen 9 Homebrew Pokedex)
- All moves and abilities have their description and other information available. No more cross checking information with the core rulebook, erratas or other documentation
- Pokemon move lists have been updated based on what they learned on the mainline games. If the move was not a part of the PTU movelist and it appeared on multiple generation, the newest generation learn level is used.
- Different filters to help out building a team. (More incoming!)
